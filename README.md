# Django React Notes Web App
I followed the tutorial below to create a full stack web application with user authentication using django and react.

I then deployed the site using choreo: [website preview](https://84e54057-2113-4e7e-b7be-b678a6e259ed.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapps.dev/).
If you can't login, it may be because the database is down. Message me if you wanna access it (I have to restart the database manually haha)


# Key take aways
* Configure database if settings.py in the backend.
* Authentication is hard and you should leave it to django.
* Still a bit unsure on handling views and stuff for the backend. (revisit)
* Use vite and its folder structure.
* User sessions are handled using jwt tokens on the frontend in a file called api.js .
* Deploying isn't that bad.
